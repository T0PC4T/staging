        The <i>Juventutem</i> International Federation is pleased to announce
        that Henry Walker (England) succeeds Bertalan Kiss (Hungary) as
        President and John Paul Makilya (Kenya, New York) succeeds Monica Clarke
        (USA) as Secretary. Cosimo Marti (Switzerland, Italy) stays on as
        Treasurer as does Fr Armand de Malleray, FSSP (UK) as Chaplain. We are
        grateful to all at the Bureau, and in our local groups for their past
        and current involvement at the service of the sanctification of the
        young according to the Roman traditions of the Church.

        Please visit the pages of our various chapters to communicate and book
        for the forthcoming events, notably: the Pilgrimage of Christendom from
        Paris to Chartres on the weekend of Pentecost; the annual Summer Weekend
        in the UK (Ampleforth Abbey, Yorkshire, 21-23 July 2023); and WYD (see
        below).

      <p><b>World Youth Day: Lisbon 2-6 August 2023</b></p>
      <p>
        Whereas the uncertainty affecting the celebration of the traditional
        Latin liturgy precludes participation on the same scale as at previous
        World Youth Days, <i>Juventutem</i> will be present in Lisbon. Adequate
        venue has been secured in the centre of the capital. Doctrinal and
        spiritual conferences, and liturgies, will be held daily. Please note
        that <i>Juventutem</i> will take no booking of any kind. Pilgrims must
        secure their travel, accommodation, meals and any such arrangements
        separately from <i>Juventutem</i>. The location and schedule will be
        advertised on <i>Juventutem</i> medias in time before WYD begins.
